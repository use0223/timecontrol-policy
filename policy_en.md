# Privacy Policy — TimeControl
**Last updated:** 2025-09-21

TimeControl (“the App”) respects your privacy. This policy explains what we process, why, and your rights.

## 1) Controller
TimeControl (indie developer).  
Contact: **suporttimecontroluse@gmail.com** 

## 2) Data we process
- **App usage data (local):**
    - Preferences (language/theme), streak progress, local ranking, scheduled activities, settings, and Premium.
    - Stored **on your device** via local storage (SharedPreferences/files).
- **Optional profile (after unlock):**
    - Alias (username), age (only visible in your profile/forms), and **profile photo** if you choose to upload.
    - Stored locally. Only shared if **you** submit it for “Master Social” or support.
- **Help/support messages & “Master Social” requests:**
    - Subject and message content, alias and age.
    - Sent to our support inbox and kept for moderation and response.
- **Advertising (Google AdMob):**
    - AdMob may collect the device advertising ID, approximate IP, ad events (impression/click), and performance metrics per its policies.
- **Embedded content (YouTube):**
    - Videos are displayed within the App. **YouTube/Google** may process data under their own privacy policy.

We do **not** process:
- Payment card data (purchases are handled by Google Play/App Store).
- Precise location.
- Additional first-party analytics SDKs.

## 3) Purposes
- Provide App features: planning, streaks/ranking, local reminders, and resources viewer.
- Show advertising to fund the free version.
- Handle support/help and “Master Social” submissions.
- Moderation and misuse prevention.

## 4) Legal bases
- **Contract/performance**: core App functionality.
- **Consent**: personalized ads (where required) and voluntary submissions.
- **Legitimate interests**: safety, fraud prevention, and basic ad SDK metrics.

## 5) Retention
- Local data: remains **on your device** until you clear app data or uninstall.
- Support/“Master Social”: kept as long as needed to resolve requests and to comply with legal obligations (if any).

## 6) Sharing
- We **do not sell** your data.
- Processors/partners:
    - **Google Mobile Ads (AdMob)**: ads.
    - **YouTube/Google**: embedded videos.
    - Email/support provider: ticket handling.

Each provider processes data under its own terms.

## 7) Children
Intended for users **13+** (or your country’s equivalent). If we learn of underage use without valid consent, we may restrict features.

## 8) Your rights
Depending on your region: access, rectification, erasure, objection, restriction, and withdraw consent (e.g., for personalized ads).

Contact **suporttimecontroluse@gmail.com**. You can also:
- Reset your **Advertising ID** in system settings.
- Revoke ad consent (where a consent dialog is available).
- Delete local data: System Settings > Apps > TimeControl > Storage > Clear data.

## 9) Security
We apply reasonable technical and organizational measures. No system is 100% secure.

## 10) Changes
We’ll post updates in-app and/or in the project repository. Continued use means you accept the updated policy.
